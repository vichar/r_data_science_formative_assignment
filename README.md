## üìÇ Overview

This formative assignment is designed to help you consolidate key concepts in R programming, including vectorization, control flow, function writing, data manipulation, and basic visualization. You are encouraged to reference course materials and seek additional learning resources if needed.

## ‚úÖ Assignment Questions

### Q1: R Programming Concepts

Answer each question in **no more than 60 words**:

- **a)** What is vectorization in R, and what are its benefits?

   Vectorisation is an implicit process in R where an operation can be peformed on each elements of a vector.
  A benefit of vecitorisation is that the code becomes more readable because there is no need to explicitly loop over elements of vector.
  for example two vectors can added together or a numerical value can be muliplied for all the vector values.
  
- **b)** What is recycling in R? Provide an example.  
- **c)** What is operator precedence? Provide an R example.  
- **d)** What is function scope, and why is it important?

### Q2: Control Flow and Looping

- **a)** Write an R function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the first `n` Fibonacci numbers as a vector.  
- **b)** Write a `while` loop that prints Fibonacci numbers **until their sum exceeds 1000**.

---

### Q3: Functions and Data Manipulation

- **a)** Write a function `calculate_mean_sd()` that takes a numeric vector and returns a **list** containing its **mean** and **standard deviation**.  
- **b)** Write a function `filter_data()` that accepts:
  - a **data frame**,  
  - a **column name**, and  
  - a **threshold** value.  
  It should return a filtered data frame with rows where the column value exceeds the threshold.

### Q4: Data Manipulation and Analysis with `mtcars`

Using R‚Äôs built-in `mtcars` dataset:

- **a)** Identify the cars with the **highest** and **lowest** `mpg` (miles per gallon).  
- **b)** Calculate the **average weight (`wt`)** for cars grouped by number of cylinders (`cyl`).  
  _Hint: Consider using `tapply()` for a concise solution._

### Q5: Data Visualization

Use the provided script [`Generate-data-1.R`](Generate-data-1.R) to generate your dataset.
``` r
# For the scatter-plot, you can use this code to generate the data:
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x^3 + rnorm(100)

# And for the box-plot, you can use this code to generate the data:
set.seed(1)
data <- list(
  Group1 = rnorm(100),
  Group2 = rnorm(100, mean = 2),
  Group3 = rnorm(100, mean = 1.5)
)
``` 

- **a)** Write your own R code to generate a **scatter plot** matching the one linked in the course materials.

- **b)** Write your own R code to generate a **box plot** matching the one linked in the course materials.
